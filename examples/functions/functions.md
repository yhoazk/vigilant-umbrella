* Declared with the keyword `fn`
* Arguments have their type at the right after a colon
* Return types are specified with the operator `->` followed by the type
* Functions also have types, the type is the functions signature
* There's no need to return from a function, but is available for early returns
* The last expression is returned by default
* Functions w/o especific return type return the type `Unit`, similar to `void`
* Nested functions are supported
