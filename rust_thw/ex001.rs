// All Rust programs start with a main function
fn main() {
    // println! is a macro that prints a string to stdout. For now you can just
    // think of macros as being the same as functions.
    println!("Hello, World");
}

// This program is fairly simple. Don't stress too much about it. Just get used
// to the way it looks.
